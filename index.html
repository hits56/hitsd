      Welcome to South Slave Shore National Park. In this park, our goal is to preserve the nature around us, so you as
      tourists can explore and discover the magnificence of our park on your own. You are guaranteed to enjoy thousands
      of lakes of all shapes and sizes at our park, from ones that are less them 100 meters across to the massive Great Slave
      Lake. Our rolling hills are not too high, only reaching elevations of about 200 meters which is an ideal place to
      go hiking across. Ascend the hills and see the surrounding landscape, and descend down the hills to enjoy the
      forest around you. With a big lake nearby, walk along the shores of Great Slave Lake, or even take a ferry to some
      of the northern islands and have the experience of a lifetime.

    <h2><a name=Adventure>The Adventure Campsite:</a></h2>

    <p>
      Calling all adventurers! If you qualify as one, campsite 6 is for you. Its rugged terrain makes camping on
      the slant of a hill or even dangling from treetops possible! This campsite provides even campers with the highest
      level of experience a challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Campsite 6 is a special campsite. Nestled in rugged terrain, it is for campers who have a <b>high level of
      experience with camping</b>. Those who are inexperienced are recommended to bring someone experienced, but all are welcome.
      The table below (May need to scroll down a bit) shows the information for this campsite, the RV park, the Park
      Lodge and the Boathouse Site.
    </p>

    <h2><a name='RV+Park'>RV Park:</a></h2>

    <p>
      The RV park is great if you just want to relax, but don't want to spend too much time cooking outside, setting up
      a tent, and having a hard time when there is rain. Our RV park offers enjoyment for those who are craving an
      escape but not too full of exploration.
    </p>

    <h2><a name=Lodge>Park Lodge:</a></h2>

    <p>
      For people who want to take relaxation to a whole new level, the Park Lodge is a good option for you. Each lodge

    <h1>Physical and Ecological Features</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
      We have a lot of cool facts and awesome features. Continue below to learn more about us.
    </p>

    <h2>Landform:</h2>

    <p>
      <img src='assets/maps/interior_plains.png'>
    </p>

    <p>
      Our land is composed of two very distinct parts. The western half is part of the Interior Plains and have rolling
      hills and rich soil. They were formed around 1.9 billion years ago and are made of sediments worn down from the
      Canadian Shield. The eastern half is part of the Canadian Shield which has rugged terrain and little soil.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Canadian Shield is one of the oldest regions of the world, being formed nearly 4 billion years ago. This
      region used to have high mountains but millions of years of erosion have worn them down to the rolling hills they
      have now. The last ice age had glaciers that, when the planet began to warm up again, retreated and scraped the
      soil off, leaving the rocky look today.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Interior Plains used to be shallow seas with aquatic life. The seas housed many marine animals and coral
      reefs. When the ground under the sea rose, the coral reefs died and left behind fossil fuels and fertile soil from
      the dead marine animals. The land is now used for farming and extraction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our land is on the Canadian boreal and taiga forest, with its coniferous trees and cold weather. The treeline is
      still further north than us meaning that our trees can still survive, though with some special
      adaptations.<br><br>
      <img src=assets/photographs/taiga.png>
    </p>

    <h2>Wildlife:</h2>

    <p>
      In the western part of Great Slave Lake, lake whitefish are abundant as they avoid the deeper areas of the
      eastern part. In the eastern part, lake trout and grayling can be seen. Near the southern shore, you can find
      goldeye, white suckers, and walleye.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Great Slave Lake is part of the Canadian boreal and taiga forest. This means that there are many birds and
      mammals adapted to the cold. The boreal forest contains moose, caribou, grizzly and black bears, wolves,
      kingfishers, bobcats, owls, and chickadees. Many of these animals have adapted to the climate of the boreal forest
      such as gaining white fur, thicker feathers, or better senses to find and catch its prey.

    <p>
      Our land lies south of the treeline, meaning that you can find coniferous forests in us. We are however between
      the woodland and tundra climate regions. We have jack pine and spruce near the lake in thick forests.<br><br>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2><a name='Rocher+River'>The Sad History of Rocher River:</a></h2>

    <p>
      Near the mouth of the Rocher River, there lie the ruins of an abandoned town over 200 years old. The Rocher River
      community, probably one of the first European settlements, had over 200 people, but they have been forced away by
      the school's destruction by fire in 1960, the closing of the Hudson's Bay Company's post, and the burning down of
      the Ed and Rose Demelt's store. The construction of the Taltson River dam upstream from the community further
      increased the need to leave, as the community was dependent on hunting and trapping to live. After the dam was
      built, the community which once thrived at Rocher River all left, leaving an abandoned village.
    </p>

    <p>
      The former residents of the Rocher River found themselves in a new place. Some got a job, some joined other first
      nations tribes, and some even found a good home. However, there were those who were not so lucky. The unfortunate
      individuals found themselves turning to alcoholism and ending up dying on the streets of Yellowknife.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the once inhabitants of Rocher River still return to their seasonal cabins where the former town was.
    </p>

    <h2>The History of Great Slave Lake:</h2>

    <p>
      The Great Slave Lake is one of the several large lakes in northern Canada, and they were made from retreating
      glaciers that scraped soil away and melted to create the lake we know today. The deepest point of the lake,
      Christie Bay (which is not in our park), is 614 meters, carved from the glaciers that one existed. This lake, like
      the other large northern lakes, lays on the boundary between the Interior Plains and the Canadian
      Shield.<br><br>
      <img src=assets/photographs/great_slave_lake.png>
    </p>

    <p>
      Evidence of civilization living near Great Slave Lake can be traced back to over 5000 BCE, belonging to the people
      of the Dene, otherwise known as 'Slaveys' who lived on the eastern shore of the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in the 18th to the 19th century, as the exploration of Canada started, non-indigenous people (Europeans)
      Started to visit, and even settle near Great Slave Lake. Trade was developed between the indigenous and the
      non-indigenous, as the Dene people began to establish their own trading post. As time passes, more trading posts
      became apparent, including Fort Resolution, after the Hudson Bay Company and the North West Company
      combined.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      In the late 19th century, social changes to the indigenous people living around Great Slave Lake started. The
      arrival of Christian missionaries set down the establishment of 3 residential schools near Great Slave Lake. The
      first one in Fort Providence, The Second one in Hay River and The final one in Fort Resolution.

      <abbr title='Fort Resolution Residential School'><img src='assets/photographs/residential_school.png'></abbr>
    </p>

    <p>
      The First Nations near the trading posts started to complain, and there were disputes between them and other
      tribes and also with the Europeans, and some First Nations made complaints about their rights to fishing taken
      away. The Europeans decided that it was best to just offer them a one time payment to settle their legal claims
      with the government.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      The discovery of gold in 1934 set off a chain of events in the North side of the lake, causing a gold rush. A
      company, Consolidated Mining and Smelting opened Con Mine in 1938, and was joined with another one, Great Mine in
      1948 after World War II. Later, a zinc mine was opened on the south shore of Great Slave Lake, and a town was built
      and later abandoned after the closure of the zinc mine in 1988, Con Mine in 2003 and Great Mine the year
      following.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, the post war period brought many fishers to Great Slave Lake, and with an analysis done by
      biologists, the lake was found to be blooming with fish, and this would be a great opportunity for the harvesting
      of fish. As a result, the government established fisheries near the shores of Great Slave Lake, where both
      indigenous and non-indigenous people would often come and fish.

    <h1>Park Sustainability</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Actions:</h2>

    <p>
      We are cleaning up the arsenic in and around the park and lake. The arsenic trioxide was produced in the Giant
      Mine that produced gold. The mine has since closed but the arsenic is still floating around. An enormous 237 000
      tons of arsenic dust was stored underground just hundreds of meters from the lake, threatening further
      contamination. We will collaborate with the ongoing cleanup from the government.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can help us by not throwing trash into the lake and not drinking the lake water. Please do not feed wild
      animals as they may eat something different. Feeding them unknown foods may shock their systems and could cause
      injury or death to the animal.
    </p>

    <h2>Park Rules:</h2>

    <p>
      Failure to follow basic park rules will result in warnings, fines and permanent bans from our park. Several
      basic ones are listed below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Leave the park the way you found it.</li>
      <li>Keep twigs and leaves where they were, whether on a tree or on the ground.</li>
      <li>Dispose of your garbage in proper Sanitary Disposal Stations and use proper restrooms and outhouses.</li>
      <li>Everyone is here to have an extra day off work, so please treat them the way you would want to be treated.</li>
      <li>No loud noises past 22:00 in our campsites.</li>
      <li>No game shall be caught in this park.</li>
      <li>Go to the designated areas for your activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs:</h2>

    <p>
      Q: How can I get here?<br>
      A: You can get here by taking the Fort Resolution highway and continuing on the extension to the park.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Can I cancel my campsite reservation once I confirmed it?<br>
      A: Absolutely. You can cancel anytime. Just go to the booking spreadsheet, go to my campsites, and then click
      on the cancel button.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: How do I change a campsite?<br>
      A: Just go to the booking spreadsheet, go to my campsites, and then click on change. Then choose a new campsite.
      Be warned that others may have picked the campsite that you want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Why doesn't campsite 6 fall under the 'campsites' category?<br>
      A: Campsite 6 is a special campsite. Its difficulty level is much higher than the conventional ones (Campsites
      1-5). It is because of its difficulty which makes it stand out from the rest so we include it with the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Is the drinking water safe, or should I still boil my water?<br>
      A: The tap water has been filtered and safe. However, we strongly recommend that you still boil your drinking
      water as other bacteria may have found their way into the water after our filtration but before usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Do I have to purchase firewood?<br>
      A: Yes, you are not allowed to use wood from our park or bring your own firewood, mainly because the preservation
      of our park is very important to us and you are not allowed to bring your own for the risk of invasive species.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: If I booked a spot in the lodge or the boathouses, what should I bring?<br>
      A: At the bare minimum, you should bring a small propane stove (With gas), a sleeping bag, some food (with a
      cooler), some clothes, and toiletries. Washrooms and empty bunks at the lodge and the boathouses are supplied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q: Is it safe to swim in the lake?<br>
      A: If you want to, you can. However, keep in mind that some areas of the lake has moderate levels of arsenic, so exercise
      caution when there are toddlers playing around. Do not encourage them to drink the lake water or eat the dirt or mud.

      "The park was good, not as bad as the other one's I've been to before. Like the place has good stuff such as the
      trails, good showers, and yeah. Something I'd've wanted to know beforehand that the campsites were full of
      people, but other than that the place is great."<br>

      "I booked campsite 6. I thought I was good with all my skills, but don't underestimate this campsite. While I as
      camping slanted, a jagged rock ripped my tent and I rolled down like maybe 10 meters. To whoever is reading
      this, be careful and be prepared. Get good gear. The campsite shops got it all. Otherwise, a great place to
      spend if you don't break your arm."<br>

      "Went for an 8 day medley. Each day I would cycle to each of the different campsites. They were all good, and
      being sort of a litterer, I did get shouted ad by some old guy from camp 5, but that's fine. This park is
      sick!"<br>

      "The whole park thing was pretty good. I went on their website and it looked pretty professional, especially for
      a new one. The fact that the webpage actually resembles and feels like the actual park is something I wouldn't
      have expected. Pretty happy that I booked early to check it out. The staff there were really nice and were
      extremely helpful. I nearly walked off into the outhouse thinking it was a smaller cabin and a passing worker
      called out to me to stop. Would come here next year for sure."<br>
